- You start with a certain number of attempts.

- If you guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts, you win!
- If the hangman is completed before you guess the word, you lose.


## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling server-side development.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, providing robust features for web and mobile applications.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language for both the frontend and backend, enhancing interactivity and functionality.
- **JSON**: A lightweight data interchange format used to store and transfer words and hints.

## Custom API

The Hangman game features a custom API that allows users to:
